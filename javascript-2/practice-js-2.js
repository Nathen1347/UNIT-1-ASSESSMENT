/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
var gitHubDefinition = 'Github is a website where you can upload code and have it looked at our worked on by multiple people. It is also a good way to store code. Like a cloud system'
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 9////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

//CODE HERE
let add = {
    description: 'Git add will make sure the modified versions are added to what will be commited later on',

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
